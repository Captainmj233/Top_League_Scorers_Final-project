Predictive analysis of Top league Scorers data through the use of descriptive statistics and visualizations 

For this project, I analyzed the top league scorers in a specific sports league using both descriptive and predictive analysis techniques. 
The dataset Top league Scorers retrieved from Kaggle is a dataset consisting of statistics of players from top leagues in the world from 2016 to 2020. 
In the descriptive analysis, I used summary statistics and visualization techniques to explore and present the distribution of the scores. This project was executed in the R studio using R programming language.
